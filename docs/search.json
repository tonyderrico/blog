    "text": "Maternal occupational exposures during early stages of pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in the NINFEA birth-cohort\n\nObjectives\nMaternal occupational exposures during early pregnancy can be detrimental to foetus health and have short- and long-term health effects on the child. This study examined their association with adverse birth outcomes.\n\n\nMethods\nThe study included 3938 nulliparous women from the Italian NINFEA mother-child cohort. Their occupational exposures during the first trimester of pregnancy were assessed through prospectively collected questionnaire information and job-exposure matrices. Associations between maternal exposures and birthweight, preterm birth, and delivery by caesarean section were analysed by multivariable linear and logistic regression models. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out to explore co-exposure profiles in association with birth outcomes.\n\n\nResults\nWomen exposed to passive smoking at work and those who reduced their working hours during pregnancy were found to have an increased likelihood of all analysed birth outcomes. Children of mothers performing a demanding work were less likely to be born preterm [OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.95)] and more likely to have a higher birthweight [β = 40.4 g (95% CI 7.5 to 73.4)]. Maternal exposures to heat and dust were associated with a lower birthweight [β = -160.1 g (95% CI -299.6 to -20.7)] and increased odds of caesarean section [OR 6.99 (95% CI 2.36 to 25.47)], respectively.\n\n\nConclusions\nThis study provides some evidence of the selection of healthy population into the workforce and of association between work-related passive smoking, heat and dust and adverse birth outcomes."

    "text": "Objectives:\nMaternal occupational exposures during early pregnancy can negatively impact foetal health, potentially leading to short- and long-term health consequences for the child. This study investigated the relationship between maternal occupational exposures and adverse birth outcomes, including birthweight, preterm birth, and delivery by caesarean section.\nMethods:\nThe study analyzed 3,938 nulliparous women from the Italian NINFEA cohort. Maternal exposures during the first trimester were assessed using questionnaires and job-exposure matrices. Multivariable regression models examined associations between exposures and birth outcomes. Exploratory factor analysis explored co-exposure profiles related to outcomes.\nResults:\n\nWomen exposed to passive smoking at work or those who reduced working hours during pregnancy had a higher likelihood of adverse birth outcomes.\nDemanding work was linked to reduced odds of preterm birth (OR 0.72) and higher birthweight (increase of 40.4 g).\nHeat exposure was associated with lower birthweight (decrease of 160.1 g).\nDust exposure increased the likelihood of caesarean section (OR 6.99).\n\nConclusions:\nThe findings suggest a “healthy worker effect” and demonstrate significant associations between occupational exposures (passive smoking, heat, and dust) and adverse birth outcomes. This underscores the need for protective measures for pregnant women in the workplace.\nMaternal occupational exposures during early stages of pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes in the NINFEA birth-cohort"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Financial redress for victims of occupational diseases can be offered through no-fault compensation schemes. No-fault compensation schemes have an explicit mission in promoting perceived fairness and justice.\nThe objective is to offer a quick, fair and just procedure and outcome, while preventing civil court procedures and restoring trust. However, the question is whether applicants of these no-fault schemes indeed experience perceived fairness and justice. This paper discusses the result of an in-depth interview study with fifty-eight victims involved in no-fault schemes for occupational diseases in the Netherlands. We focus on the role of perceived procedural justice, outcome concerns and trust in the (former) employer.\nClick to read the paper!"
