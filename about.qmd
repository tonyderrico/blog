## “Working in healthy conditions is a right, and conducting quality research plays a fundamental role in supporting workers worldwide.”

Antonio (Toni) is a postdoctoral researcher in the Occupational Health group at the Institute of Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS) of Utrecht University. He is trained in occupational and environmental epidemiology, with a focus on exposure science. His work primarily focuses on the LEXCES project, the national expertise center for substance-related occupational diseases, and the EPHOR project, the Exposome Project for Health and Occupational Research. 

Toni holds a MSc in Toxicology and Environmental Health from Utrecht University and a PhD from the University of Turin. His doctoral research centered on the external exposome in life-course studies, particularly examining a wide range of occupational and environmental exposures during pregnancy and early life stages and their potential associations with birth outcomes. 

Throughout his academic journey, Toni has collaborated with various academic and research institutes, including the Universitat de València in the Food Toxicology Unit (2016); the Universidad de Vigo at the Occupational Health and Safety Department (2017); the KWR Water Research Institute and Allied Waters at the Chemical Water Quality Unit (2019, Nieuwegein); the NGO La Isla Network (2020); the ISGlobal (Instituto de Salud Global) (2022, Barcelona) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in the Food Safety Unit (2022, Oslo). During these experiences, Toni advanced his expertise combining fieldwork (industrial hygiene), lab (MS-techniques) and methodological and computational approaches in epidemiology. 

In addition to his research, Toni actively contributes to the NPO Workplace Health Without Borders (WHWB) working groups on asbestos and heat stress. Through these initiatives, he collaborates with other experts to share his scientific knowledge and support workplace health initiatives in low- and middle-income countries.
